# FiniteElementMethod
## Program Purpose and Output
The purpose of the program is to generate data on the temperature distribution over time in a 2D element.
The program outputs .vtk files, which can be used to create simulations, for example, in the ParaView application.
## Example Temperature Simulation
ParaView simulation created based on the output from my program.
